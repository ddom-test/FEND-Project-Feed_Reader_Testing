## Overview

This project is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, the purpose is to write tests using the Jasmine framework. You can see tests' outcome opening index.html in a normal web browser!



## Description

To complete the project, a series of tests will be run against the application to ensure that:

* each feed in the `allFeeds` object has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty;
* each feed in the `allFeeds` object has a name defined and that the name is not empty;
* the menu element is hidden by default;
* the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked;
* when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container;
* when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function the content actually changes.
